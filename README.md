# Detecting- Covid19-CXR-and-CT-images-using-Deep-Learning

Detecting and classifying CT and CXR Covid-19 images using Deep Learning and more precisly with the use of Python programming languagealong with its libraries and frameworks TensorFlow, Keras, numpy, pandas, matplot, confusion matrix and more. This was done with Jupyter Notebook.

# Abstract

The novel coronavirus 2019 – else SARS-CoV-2, that first appeared in Wuhan city, China, has since very rapidly spread around the entire world. At the moment, the pandemic is still spreading, and has a devastating effect on the global population and on the world’s healthcare systems and economy. A medical tool to combat the spread of the pandemic is the early screening and recognition of Covid-19 with the use of Chest X-rays and CT scans. This study aims to create a Deep Learning Convolutional Neural Network model that automatically detects Covid-19 pneumonia by Chest X-ray and CT images with the use of TensorFlow framework and Keras API. The dataset consists of 1156 total images, where 410 are X-ray images and 746 are CT images. The classification accuracy that is achieved in this study is 98,35% for CXR images, but only 60% for CT images. However, while for CT images the proposed model did not perform so well, for the CXRs was proven to be extremely effective, demonstrating a strong performance, and achieved a remarkably high accuracy for Covid-19 detection and classification.

# Problem definition and aim
To effectively control the wide spread of SARS-CoV-2 virus, an early diagnosis is imperative. This can only be achieved by performing a very large number of public screening and diagnosis, with isolation and treatment if necessary.

The commonly used molecular testing comes with various problems. Not only because of the high number of negative outcomes - hence the non-ideal accuracy ratio, but also because of the relatively large amount of time required for the results to be produced. Even more important are the serious deficiencies in the manufacturing processes, and more so in the worldwide supply chain. Therefore, it is apparent that quick and precise methods are an absolute necessity.

Artificial Intelligence and more specifically Machine Learning and Deep Learning, can fight against the virus in their own ways to prevent its spread, therefore eliminating the biggest problems we are facing.

Motivated by the recent applications of Artificial Intelligence in various areas, and in light of the Covid-19 caused radiographical changes in Chest X-rays and CT images, a decision was taken to build a Deep Learning Convolutional Neural Network model that will be able to extract the disease’s graphical features, give clinical analysis, and additionally save critical time in order to control the spread of the disease.

A classification technique from Deep Learning, TensorFlow framework along with Keras API will be used to classify positive and negative Covid-19 cases from Chest X-ray and Computer Tomography radiograph images. While accuracy is the most important issue, by adding more images, therefore data, and increase the iterations, accuracy of the Deep Learning CNN (convolutional neural network) model can improve significantly. Moreover, we will compare CXR accuracy against CT accuracy in order to identify which one provides the best results, as well as present the benefits and disadvantages of using either one.
